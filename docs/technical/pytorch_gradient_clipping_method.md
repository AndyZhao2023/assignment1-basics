# How PyTorch Actually Implements Gradient Clipping

## PyTorch's Method

Based on the PyTorch source code, `clip_grad_norm_` uses:

```python
# Step 1: Compute norm of each gradient tensor
norms = []
for g in grads:
    norms.append(torch.linalg.vector_norm(g, norm_type))

# Step 2: Compute total norm using vector norm of the norms
total_norm = torch.linalg.vector_norm(
    torch.stack([norm.to(first_device) for norm in norms]), 
    norm_type
)
```

For L2 norm (norm_type=2), this is equivalent to:
```python
# Each individual norm
individual_norms = [g.norm(2) for g in grads]

# Total norm 
total_norm = torch.stack(individual_norms).norm(2)
```

Which mathematically equals:
```
total_norm = sqrt(norm1² + norm2² + norm3² + ...)
```

## Comparison with Our Methods

### Our Method 1 (what we originally had):
```python
total_norm = 0.0
for grad in gradients:
    total_norm += grad.norm(2).item() ** 2
total_norm = total_norm ** 0.5
```

### Our Method 2 (what we changed to):
```python
total_norm = 0.0
for grad in gradients:
    total_norm += grad.pow(2).sum().item()
total_norm = total_norm ** 0.5
```

### PyTorch's Method:
```python
norms = [grad.norm(2) for grad in gradients]
total_norm = torch.stack(norms).norm(2)
```

## Mathematical Equivalence

All three methods compute the same thing:
- **Method 1**: `sqrt(sum(||gi||₂²))` 
- **Method 2**: `sqrt(sum(all elements²))`
- **PyTorch**: `||[||g1||₂, ||g2||₂, ||g3||₂]||₂`

They're mathematically identical because:
```
||[||g1||₂, ||g2||₂, ||g3||₂]||₂ = sqrt(||g1||₂² + ||g2||₂² + ||g3||₂²)
```

## Why PyTorch Uses This Method

1. **Leverages optimized implementations**: `torch.linalg.vector_norm` is highly optimized
2. **Device efficiency**: Can use `torch._foreach_norm` for parallel computation on supported devices
3. **Consistent API**: Uses the same norm functions throughout PyTorch
4. **Better numerical stability**: Less manual floating-point arithmetic

## Performance Comparison

PyTorch's approach might be faster because:
- `torch.stack()` and `torch.norm()` are implemented in C++/CUDA
- Can utilize vectorized operations and GPU parallelism
- Avoids Python loops for norm computation

Our Method 1 is actually **closest to PyTorch's approach** conceptually:
- Both compute individual gradient norms first
- Both combine them using the mathematical identity

## Conclusion

**PyTorch uses Method 1 conceptually** (compute individual norms, then combine), but with more optimized tensor operations rather than Python loops. Our implementation using either method is mathematically correct, but PyTorch's approach using `torch.stack().norm()` would likely be more efficient.
